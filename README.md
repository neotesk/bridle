Bridle is a powerful project manager for ECMAScript, allowing you manage your ECMAScript projects
with ease, You can compile supersets, bundle files into one single file and perform various other
tasks. Every task is stored inside the Bridle file (stored as `bridle.ots`, a custom format I made).
Bridle aims to be simple yet very powerful, giving you the ability to do everything.

> [!WARNING]
> Bridle is currently a work in progress. You can either contribute to this project or wait for us to finish it.
